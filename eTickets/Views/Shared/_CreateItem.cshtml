@model string


@*
    We're setting the model as a string and the controller as Model
    SO when the user clicks on producers and clicks add new, its loading the model which is producer and passes that in the controller
    Need to define controller for view*@
    @if (User.Identity.IsAuthenticated && User.IsInRole("Admin"))
{
    <div style="position: fixed; right: 25px;bottom:25px;" class="text-white">
        <a asp-controller="@Model" asp-action="Create" class="btn btn-success">
            <i class="bi bi-plus-circle"></i> Add New
        </a>
    </div>
}
