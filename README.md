# eTickets-ASP.NET-MVC-Ecom-App
eTickets is an online movie ticket system created with ASP.NET MVC and uses SQL database with EF Core for storing information about actors, movies, producers, locations, orders and so on (typical CRUD operations). 

RESTful services such as dependency injection and generic base repositories were used to develop this application. 
.NET Identity Framework was used to implement authentication and authorization with role-based UI rendering. No scaffolding was used to develop the login system, it was coded from the ground up. 
Paypal has been integrated and the entire project is deployed on Azure.
